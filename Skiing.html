            <h3 id="ski">One of my favorite hobbies and activities to do is ski. I learned how to ski 
                when I was 10 years old and fell in love with the sport. My Dad grew up skiing 
                from a young age and taught me a lot of what I know. My family and I have traveled 
                to several mountains out west to go skiing. A few favorties are Copper Mountain, 
                Breckenridge, and Steamboat Springs. I still have so many more mountains on my 
                bucketlist to hit. So far I have enjoyed every place I have skied in Colorado and Utah.
                I definietly would like to go back to <a href="https://www.deervalley.com/">Deer Valley Mountain</a>
                in the near future. Deer Valley is very comforting to me and brings back a lot of memories.  
                
                Overall I just love the mountains, views, and thrill from skiing. The runs are 
                super fun to explore and take in. Additionally, I love how skiing is also considered 
                exercise. It never feels like exercise which is even better, and I get so many 
                endorphins just from going down the mountain. Skiing makes me so happy and I'm 
                looking forward to the next mountain I get to visit.</h3>
